# bioRxiv-LaTeX-template

This is a **LaTeX** template for scientific publications (e.g. on [BioRxiv](http://www.biorxiv.org)) that contains several examples of how to embed figures directly into the manuscript. It is derived from [Schlegel et al., (2016)](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/04/07/044990).

To use download **template.tex** and change to your needs. Additional files (figure PDFs + libraby.bib) are only necessary to compile complete PDF.

You can run your own LaTeX compiler or use online services (e.g. [Overleaf](http://www.overleaf.com)).
